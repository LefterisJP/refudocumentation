This documentation is written in org-mode. An html version is also automatically generated
and pushed to the web and can be found here [[http://refu.co/]].

Please refer to the html version since Github's org mode rendering is incomplete in many respects.
One prime example is the syntax colouring for refulang which requires [[https://github.com/LefterisJP/refu-mode][refu-mode.el]]. 
The html version is generated by an emacs equipped with the aforementioned mode and as such contains proper syntax highlighting.
* Documentation
Loosely updated documentation for refulang. This aims to contain the specification
of the language and any miscellaneous documentation that is required. It is
going to be updated as development progresses.

*WARNING:* This is absolutely a work in progress.
